JSDoc template Argon
====================

This site host some [jsodc-template-argon](https://github.com/Oza94/jsdoc-template-argon) demos :

 * [lodash](example/lodash)
 * [pixi.js](example/pixi.js)

This site was built with Argon template :)

## Documenting JSDoc internals

This project is also a way for me to discover JSDoc internals and better understand how this tool works. 

The interesting bit is the [typedefs](srctypedefjsdoc-JSDocTypedefs.html) section which documents the structure of TaffyDB records JSDoc generates.
