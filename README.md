JSDoc template Argon
=====================

*Note :* this is very much a WIP until this project reach `v1.0`

During my own documentation journey with es2015+ code, I found that it was tedious to get a nice documentation website with existing tooling. There's two alternatives :

 * [ESDoc](https://doc.esdoc.org/github.com/esdoc/esdoc/): a nice documentation tool+template built for ES2015+ code. The downside is that it is very strict compared to what you can document with JSDoc
 * [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc): the reference for JavaScript code documentation although it does not support properly all es2015+ and it lacks good website templates (in my opinion)


An example of how the template look likes :
